# 4)a) Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

##  Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `saveetha` and a method `slot` to perform the calculation.

##  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `saveetha`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `slot` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = 3.1416*r*r
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## Program
```
class saveetha:
    def slot(self,rad):
        area=3.1416*rad*rad
        print(f"Area of circle: {area:.2f}")
        
r=float(input())

circle=saveetha()
circle.slot(r)
```

## Result
Thus a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user is created
